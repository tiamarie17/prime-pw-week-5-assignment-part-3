    <ul>
      <li>On Line 15 of my JS file, is it correct to console log the function being called? Or would it be better to declare a new variable (i.e.) 'result' outside of the function in order
        to save the return value/ calling the method in that variable and console log just the variable separately?
      </li>
      <li>Figuring out the code between lines 60-63 was tough for me. I got things to work in the console, but </li>
      I'm not sure if the syntax or variable scope is correct here. Thanks for any insight or feedback!
    </ul>
