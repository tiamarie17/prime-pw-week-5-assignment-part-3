    <ul>
      <li>Figuring out how to check if the object was empty was tough for me. I got things to work in the console, but 
      I'm not sure if that is the best way to do that. Putting a function inside a function doesn't seem like the most efficient way to do that. Thanks for any insight or feedback!
      </li>
      <li> I couldn't figure out how to allow a search only by trackName that worked in the console. However, I was able to add a trackName search criteria and it would return a search if
      the artist, year, and trackName matched. I'm wondering about the syntax and variable scope of my for loops and if statements in that block (in the function search code).
    </li>
    <li>I wasn't able to figure out how to update the collection function to display the tracks in an ordered list. Where could I start with that?</li>

    </ul>
